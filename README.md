# Digit-Classification-MNIST-dataset

What is MNIST dataset?

MNIST stands for Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology, which has produced a handwritten digits dataset. This is one of the most researched datasets in machine learning, and is used to classify handwritten digits. This dataset is helpful for predictive analytics because of its sheer size, allowing deep learning to work its magic efficiently. This dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, formatted as 28 x 28 pixel monochrome images. 

Intro to digit classification:-

Handwritten digit classification is the capability of a computer to recognize human handwriting digits from various sources such as pictures, papers, touch screens, etc. and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0-9). Digit recognition has many applications such as license plate recognition, mail sorting, banking control processing, etc. Handwritten digit recognition faces many challenges due to different writing styles different nations because it is not optical character recognition. 

Structure:

The analysis of the architectural design in the system is the analysis of the system architecture. This the system helps in detecting the correct digit. This system is effective and helps to detect a classify the digit at a time and place that is convenient for the user.

Load Image: The input to the system is a handwritten digit. This input is obtained from user end. The digit used as input must be stored with an extension.
Segmentation: Digit can be RGB so it can be easier after flattening segmentation.
Feature Extraction: Based on digit detection using features digit it can extract from the data set.
Machine Learning: Machine learning is used to classify digits and their functions into several classes. This training process will create 3 outputs that correspond to the stated goals determined in the training process.
Classification: Classification is done by entering testing data into the classification system which was introduced in the previous training system. Classification results include a similar label to the numeral.
